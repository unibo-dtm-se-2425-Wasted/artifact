## Usage

### Register an Account
Users can create an account with a unique username and password.  
Passwords are stored securely using hashing.  

### Login
Log in with your credentials to access your personal food inventory.  

### Manage Food Items
Add food items with details such as name, category, purchase and expiry dates, quantity, and price.  
You can view them in a dashboard, delete them when consumed, or track their status (OK, Expiring Soon, Expired).  

### View Waste Statistics
The app calculates the number of expired items, percentage of wasted food, and estimated financial loss.  

### Get Recipe Suggestions
When items are close to expiration, the app suggests recipes that help reuse those ingredients.
